# Cyrano: Improving Couples' Communication Through Empathetic Dialogue
Additional Participants: Joe Mirza, Ziwei Zhao

For the final capstone of my Master's in Data Science, a team of myself and two others built an NLP tool that was designed to improve the empathy in the words couples used when messaging each other. 

- Takes as input the partner's original message as context, the user's message (or reply to earlier message) is analyzed and evaluated for empathy. I fempathy is too low, message is rewritten, two methods for rewriting were built. 

- Uses empathy ratings for tokens from a previous study, tool was built on top of a chatbot built for huggingface.

- Keywords: Python script
